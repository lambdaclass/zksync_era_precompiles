# How to add and test your own precompile

1. Create a *.yul file in */precompile*
2. Create an address for your precompile after *submodules/era-test-node/src/deps/system_contracts.rs:44* starting from address `( ..., 0x01, 0xFF, 0xFF)`
3. Add your precompile to the `yul_contracts` array in the same file.
4. Add your specific tests at *tests/tests/factory*
