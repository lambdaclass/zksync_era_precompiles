## Precompiles

| Name | Supported | optimized | audited |
| ---| --- | --- | --- |
| `ecAdd` | ✅ | 🏗 | 🏗 |
| `ecMul` | ✅ | 🏗 |  🏗 |
| `modExp` |  🏗  | ❌ | ❌ |
| `ecPairing` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `P256` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `secp256r1` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `secp256q1` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
## Observations

### `ecAdd`

- `invmod` needs to be optimized
- Points addition performance should be improved by using Projective Coordinates 
- The code still needs some refactoring

### `ecMul`

- `invmod` needs to be optimized
- The implementation is naive, a double and add algorithm could be used instead
- Points addition performance should be improved by using Projective Coordinates 
- The code still needs some refactoring

### Gas Usage
- Define the gas model. Should we follow eth eip's specification? or used a custom zksync gas for each operation instead? 
- We need to discuss how this piece of code should be implemented for each precompile:
```
let precompileParams := unsafePackPrecompileParams(
      0, // input offset in words
      // TODO: Double check that the input length is 4 because it could be 2
      // if the input points are packed in a single word (points as tuples of coordinates)
      3, // input length in words (x, y, scalar)
      0, // output offset in words
      // TODO: Double check that the input length is 4 because it could be 1
      // if the input points are packed in a single word (points as tuples of coordinates)
      2, // output length in words (x, y)
      0  // No special meaning, ecMul circuit doesn't check this value
)
let gasToPay := ECMUL_GAS_COST()

// Check whether the call is successfully handled by the ecMul circuit
let success := precompileCall(precompileParams, gasToPay)
let internalSuccess := mload(0)

switch and(success, internalSuccess)
case 0 {
      return(0, 0)
}
default {
      return(0, 64)
}
```
